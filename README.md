# PyTimer
PyTimer is just a simple Timer written with PyQt6!

End goal is that this would create an overlay over your main screen which displays the timer and make a sound or loop the timer

This is actually my first PyQt application.

I plan to update the PySoundBoard repo to use PyQt UI instead of TKInter
